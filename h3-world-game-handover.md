# H3 World Game Development Handover Document

## 1. Baseline Code

Our baseline is an A-Frame application that renders a global H3 hexagon grid (Resolution 1) on an Earth sphere. Key components include:

- `h3-hexagon` geometry for rendering individual hexagons
- `global-hexagon-grid` component for generating the global grid
- `hexagon-click-handler` component for basic click interactions

The baseline uses A-Frame 1.6.0, the environment component 1.3.3, and orbit controls 1.3.2.

## 2. AO and Arweave Integration

### AO (Arweave Operating System)

AO is a decentralized operating system built on Arweave. To integrate AO:

1. Install AO:
   ```
   npm install -g @aothree/ao
   ```

2. Create an AO process:
   ```javascript
   import { createAO } from '@aothree/ao';

   const ao = await createAO();
   const process = await ao.createProcess({
     name: 'H3WorldGame',
     init: `(defn init []
       {:hexagons {} :players {}})`
   });
   ```

3. Interact with the process:
   ```javascript
   const result = await process.call('claimHexagon', { hexId: 'abc123', playerId: 'player1' });
   ```

### Arweave

Arweave is a decentralized storage network. To interact with Arweave:

1. Install arweave-js:
   ```
   npm install arweave
   ```

2. Initialize Arweave:
   ```javascript
   const Arweave = require('arweave');
   const arweave = Arweave.init({
     host: 'arweave.net',
     port: 443,
     protocol: 'https'
   });
   ```

3. Store data:
   ```javascript
   const transaction = await arweave.createTransaction({ data: 'Hello, World!' });
   await arweave.transactions.sign(transaction);
   const response = await arweave.transactions.post(transaction);
   ```

## 3. H3-js API

H3 is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system. Key functions include:

1. Convert lat/lon to H3 index:
   ```javascript
   const h3Index = h3.latLngToCell(37.7752, -122.4184, 7);
   ```

2. Get hexagon boundary:
   ```javascript
   const boundary = h3.cellToBoundary(h3Index);
   ```

3. Get hexagon center:
   ```javascript
   const [lat, lon] = h3.cellToLatLng(h3Index);
   ```

4. Get neighboring hexagons:
   ```javascript
   const neighbors = h3.gridRing(h3Index, 1);
   ```

## 4. H3 to Cartesian Coordinates

We convert H3 hexagons to Cartesian coordinates for rendering:

```javascript
latLonToPoint: function(lat, lon) {
  const phi = (90 - lat) * Math.PI / 180;
  const theta = (lon + 180) * Math.PI / 180;
  const x = -Math.sin(phi) * Math.cos(theta);
  const y = Math.cos(phi);
  const z = Math.sin(phi) * Math.sin(theta);
  return [x, y, z];
}
```

This projects the hexagons onto a unit sphere, which we then scale to match our Earth model.

## 5. Game Development Plan

### Iteration 1: Enhanced Hex Interaction
- Implement hex claiming system
- Add visual indication for claimed hexes
- Create basic resource generation for claimed hexes

### Iteration 2: Player Management
- Implement player authentication using AO
- Create player inventory system
- Develop basic UI for player information

### Iteration 3: Resource Management
- Implement more complex resource generation
- Create resource trading system between players
- Develop resource visualization on hexagons

### Iteration 4: Building System
- Implement ability to construct buildings on hexes
- Create different building types with unique effects
- Develop UI for building management

### Iteration 5: Combat and Expansion
- Implement basic combat system for hex control
- Create expansion mechanics (claiming adjacent hexes)
- Develop alliances system

### Iteration 6: Economy and Markets
- Implement global marketplace for resource trading
- Create economic systems (supply/demand, pricing)
- Develop contracts system for player agreements

### Iteration 7: Missions and Quests
- Implement mission/quest system
- Create reward mechanisms for completed quests
- Develop storyline elements

### Iteration 8: Advanced Features
- Implement weather system affecting resource generation
- Create natural disasters and events
- Develop tech tree for player advancement

### Iteration 9: Multiplayer Enhancements
- Implement real-time player interactions
- Create chat system
- Develop spectator mode

### Iteration 10: Polish and Optimization
- Optimize rendering for large number of hexagons
- Implement level of detail system for distant hexagons
- Refine UI/UX based on player feedback

For each iteration, follow these steps:
1. Design: Create detailed design documents for new features
2. Implement: Develop new features, integrating with AO/Arweave as needed
3. Test: Thoroughly test new features and their integration with existing systems
4. Review: Conduct code review and gather user feedback
5. Iterate: Refine features based on feedback and testing results

Remember to continuously update the AO process and Arweave storage as new features are implemented to ensure data persistence and decentralization.
